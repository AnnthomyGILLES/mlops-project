Overview
In the fast-evolving field of machine learning (ML), the ability to efficiently operationalize models is crucial. This project is an exploration into ZenML, an MLOps framework designed to simplify and streamline the process of building and managing ML workflows. The objective is to quickly ramp up on ZenML, demonstrating its utility and effectiveness in a practical context.
Project Context
Machine Learning engineers often face challenges related to the scalability, reproducibility, and deployment of ML models. Traditional approaches can lead to cumbersome and disjointed workflows. ZenML addresses these issues, providing an elegant and powerful solution for ML operations (MLOps). This project serves as a hands-on introduction to ZenML, showcasing its capabilities through a concrete example.
Learning Objectives
The key learning objectives of this project include:
Gaining practical experience with ZenML as an MLOps tool.
Understanding how to transition from traditional ML workflows to those managed by ZenML.
Demonstrating the ease of building, running, and monitoring ML pipelines with ZenML.
Highlighting the advantages of using an MLOps framework in terms of scalability, reproducibility, and efficiency.
